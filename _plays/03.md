title: Make it simple and intuitive
---

Using software shouldn’t be stressful, confusing, or daunting. It’s our job to build products that are simple and intuitive enough that users succeed the first time, unaided.

### Checklist
1. Use a simple and flexible design style guide for the product. Use the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards) as a default 
2. Use the design style guide consistently for related digital services
3. Give users clear information about where they are in each step of the process
4. Follow accessibility best practices to ensure all people can use the service
5. Provide users with a way to exit and return later to complete the process
6. Use language that is familiar to the user and easy to understand
7. Use language and design consistently throughout the service

### Key Questions
- What primary tasks are the user trying to accomplish?
- Is the language as plain and universal as possible?
- What languages is your product offered in?
- If a user needs help while using the product, how do they go about getting it?
- How does the product's design visually relate to other products?
