title: Make it simple and intuitive
---

Using software shouldn’t be stressful, confusing, or daunting. It’s our job to build products that are simple and intuitive enough that users succeed the first time, unaided.

### Checklist
1. Use the Template Package
2. Give users clear information about where they are in each step of the process
3. Follow accessibility best practices to ensure all people can use the product
4. Provide users with a way to exit and return later to complete the process
5. Use language that is familiar to the user and easy to understand
6. Use language and design consistently throughout the product

### Key Questions
- What primary tasks are the user trying to accomplish?
- Is the language as plain and universal as possible?
- What languages is your product offered in?
- If a user needs help while using the product, how do they go about getting it?
- How does the product's design visually relate to other products?
