We need to understand the different ways people will interact with our solutions, including the actions they take on a website or through a mobile application. Every encounter should move the user closer towards their goal.

### Checklist
1. Understand the different points at which people will interact with the solution
2. Identify pain points in the current way users interact with the solution, and prioritize these according to user needs
3. Develop metrics that will measure how well the solution is meeting user needs at each step


### Key Questions
- What are the different ways that people currently accomplish the task the solution is designed to help with?
- Where are user pain points in the current way people accomplish the task?
- Where does this specific solution fit into the larger way people currently obtain the solution being offered?
- What metrics will best indicate how well the solution is working for its users?
